## How to run this application

 - Pre-requisites: Python 3.6

 - Set up a virtual environment. `virtualenv` is recommended
 - Install the apps dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage

 - Postman can be used to send requests to the app.
 - The app takes requests in JSON and responds in JSON.
 - Authentication is needed to interact with the endpoints.
 - To authenticate, send a JSON request in the form `{"email":"user@testmail.com", "password":"Pass123*"}`
   to the `/api/auth/register` endpoint. To login send the same data to the `/api/auth/login` endpoint.
   You will then be issued with an access token that lasts 15 minutes.
 - For a password reset, make sure you are first logged in and then send the new password to the reset endpoint.
 - The app accepts the following book attributes:
   `id, title, description, author, edition, category, copies_available`
 - An example JSON request is:
 ```json
   {
   "id": 4,
   "title": "Eloquent JavaScript",
   "description": "Introduction to JavaScript",
   "category": "JavaScript",
   "author": "Marjin Haverbeke",
   "Edition": "Second Edition ",
   "copies_available": 20,

   }
   ```
